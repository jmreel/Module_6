# PlanMyTrip App Project

# Project Goal
The goal of this project was to collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide. PlanMyTrip will use the data to recommend ideal hotels based on clients' weather preferences. With this information the weather description was added to the weather data. Users will then be able to input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. With the assistance of Google Maps Directions API, a travel route will be created between potential travel destinations the user will want to visit.
